# 1. Initializing with rust
## Getting Started
- Let’s start your Rust journey! There’s a lot to learn, but every journey starts somewhere. In this chapter, we’ll discuss:
- Installing Rust on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Writing a program that prints Hello, world!
- Using cargo, Rust’s package manager and build system

## Hello, World!

- Rust files always end with the .rs extension.
- Lets make a hello world in rust
```
fn main() {
println!("Hello, world!");
}
Output => Hello, world!
```
